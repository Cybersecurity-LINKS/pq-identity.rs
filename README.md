# Zero-Knowledge (ZK)

The IOTA Identity Framework now supports Zero-Knowledge functionalities, thanks to the [integration](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/1285) of two key components:

* **BBS+ Signature Scheme**: This scheme has been integrated through the [ZKryptium](https://github.com/Cybersecurity-LINKS/zkryptium) library, allowing for secure and privacy-preserving credential management.
* **JSON Web Proof Representation**: The [json-proof-token](https://github.com/Cybersecurity-LINKS/json-proof-token) library implements the JSON Web Proof specification, enabling verifiable claims with selective disclosure.

For more details on the implementation and how to use these features, you can find the full documentation [here](https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/how-tos/verifiable-credentials/zero-knowledge-selective-disclosure/).
